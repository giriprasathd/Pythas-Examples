# Pythas Examples

This repository contains a collection of application examples for the [```Pythas```](https://github.com/pinselimo/Pythas) library.
It will **grow** with time and stay up to date with the master branch of ```Pythas```. 

## Examples

The examples are contained in Jupyter Notebooks in the ```notebooks``` directory. Its subdirectories contain the accompanying Haskell code.

## Install / Dependencies

Obviously one dependency is the ```Pythas``` library. It can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/pinselimo/Pythas).
You will also have to obtain either [```Stack```](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) or [```GHC```](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/).

Although part of ```Pythas``` source is implemented in Haskell, you will not need to download any Haskell libraries and it will keep your global Haskell environment untouched.

## License

```Pythas``` is licensed under the LGPLv3 license. Some low level parts are useful enough to be available under the ```MIT``` license. This will be specified in their respective repositories.
